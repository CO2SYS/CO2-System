# CO2-System

Software to calculate marine CO2 system variables and propagate uncertainties, unique in the ability to input carbonate ion concentrations and uncertainties. CO2Sys was inititally developed by Lewis and Wallace (1998) for MS DOS, later adapted for MS Excel and MATLAB by Pierrot (2006). The code was vectorized, refined, and optimized for computational speed by van Heuven (2011). Options for error propagation were added recently by Orr et al. (2018). This software builds upon previous versions and differs only in its ability to handle carbonate ion concentrations and uncertainties as input parameters.

## Citation

If using the CO2SYS.m MATLAB program for CO2 system calculations, cite the original CO2SYS DOS work of Lewis and Wallace (1998) and the MATLAB program of van Heuven et al. (2011). If using the derivnum.m and errors.m programs for CO2 system error propagations, cite also the work of Orr et al. (2018). If explicitly using these programs with CO3 as an input, cite also Sharp and Byrne (2019).
